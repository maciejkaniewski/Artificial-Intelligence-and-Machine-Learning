# Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning

The repository contains projects I realized in the first semester of my Master's studies within the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning course at the Wroclaw University of Technology in the field of Control Engineering and Robotics.

- [Heuristic Search Checkers](https://github.com/maciejkaniewski/Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/1-Heuristic-Search-Checkers)
  
  The task was to write a heuristic function for the game of Checkers. The function had to be written in **Java**, following the provided API, in order to work with the given program. The purpose of the assignment was to become familiar with controlling search processes in the **minimax search algorithm** using a heuristic function.

- [Logistic Reasoning Wumpus](https://github.com/maciejkaniewski/Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/2-Logistic-Reasoning-Wumpus)

    The task was to program a strategy for the Wumpus World Agent. The program had to be written in **Prolog** and was executed by the [Jovolog](https://kcir.pwr.edu.pl/~witold/aiuwr/2010_projekty/jovolog/) Wumpus World Simulator. The simulator featured a built-in version of the Prolog interpreter called tuProlog.

- [Bayesian Networks Modeling](https://github.com/maciejkaniewski/Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/3-Bayesian-Networks-Modeling)

    The task was to construct a **Bayesian Decision Network** (Influence Diagram) for a chosen or personally developed problem, utilizing one of the available tools that support this model.

- [Markov Decision Problems](https://github.com/maciejkaniewski/Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/4-Markov-Decision-Problems)

    The goal was to compute solutions for discrete **Markov Decision Problems** (MDP). The assignment had two parts, each requiring a program. The first program solved the MDP problem with known parameters using value iteration or policy iteration. The second program solved the MDP problem with unknown parameters using Q-learning. The project was implemented in the **C++** language, utilizing **Python** libraries for certain functionalities.

- [Classifier Machine Learning](https://github.com/maciejkaniewski/Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/5-Classifier-Machine-Learning)
  
  The task involved building a classifier to recognize the theme of a short text (press note) within five categories: business, entertainment, politics, sport, and tech. The project made use of **Python** and the **scikit-learn** library.
